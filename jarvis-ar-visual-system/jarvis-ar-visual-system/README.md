# Jarvis AR Visual System

## Overview
The Jarvis AR Visual System is an advanced augmented reality application designed to integrate visual rendering with real-time camera tracking and object detection. This project aims to provide a seamless user experience by combining interactive user interfaces with immersive graphics.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key directories:

- **src/**: Contains the main source code for the application.
  - **rendering/**: Manages the rendering engine, shaders, and materials.
  - **ar/**: Implements camera tracking, object detection, and pose estimation.
  - **ui/**: Handles user interface elements and gesture controls.
  - **graphics/**: Manages scene graphs, lighting, and visual effects.
  - **utils/**: Provides utility functions for mathematical operations and configuration management.

- **assets/**: Contains resources such as shaders, 3D models, and textures used in the application.

- **tests/**: Includes unit tests for various modules to ensure code reliability and functionality.

- **config/**: Holds configuration files for rendering and augmented reality settings.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## Features
- **Rendering Engine**: A robust rendering engine that integrates shaders and materials for high-quality graphics.
- **Augmented Reality**: Real-time camera tracking and object detection capabilities to enhance user interaction.
- **User Interface**: An intuitive user interface with gesture controls and HUD elements for a better user experience.
- **Modular Design**: The project is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd jarvis-ar-visual-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
