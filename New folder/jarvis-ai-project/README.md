# Jarvis AI Project

## Overview
The Jarvis AI Project is a comprehensive AI/ML development workspace focused on traditional machine learning and deep learning. This project aims to provide a structured environment for building, training, and deploying machine learning models using popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

- **src/**: Contains the main source code for the project.
  - **data/**: Utilities for data loading and preprocessing.
  - **models/**: Definitions and architectures of machine learning models.
  - **training/**: Scripts for training models and managing experiments.
  - **inference/**: Code for model inference and predictions.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions for configuration loading and logging.

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model prototyping.

- **tests/**: Unit tests for various modules in the project.

- **config/**: Configuration files for project settings, model parameters, and training configurations.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

- **setup.py**: Used for packaging the project.

## Installation
To set up the Jarvis AI Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jarvis-ai-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for exploratory data analysis and model prototyping.
- The source code in the `src/` directory can be imported and used to build and train models.
- Configuration files in the `config/` directory can be modified to adjust settings for different experiments.
