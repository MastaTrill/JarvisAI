# Jarvis AI Project

## Overview
The Jarvis AI Project is a comprehensive machine learning and deep learning framework designed to facilitate the development, training, and deployment of AI models. This project supports both traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning techniques, providing a robust environment for experimentation and model evaluation.

```

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd jarvis-ai-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Use the functions in `src/data/preprocessing.py` and `src/data/loaders.py` to preprocess and load your datasets.
2. **Model Training**: Utilize the `Trainer` class in `src/training/trainer.py` to manage the training process. Configure your training parameters in `config/training_config.yaml`.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate your models using the methods defined in `src/models/base_model.py` and `src/models/neural_networks.py`.
4. **Inference**: Make predictions with your trained models using the `Predictor` class in `src/inference/predictor.py`.

## Experiment Tracking
The project integrates with MLflow and Weights & Biases for experiment tracking. Ensure to configure your tracking settings in `config/training_config.yaml`.
