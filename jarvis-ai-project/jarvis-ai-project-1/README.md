# Jarvis AI Project

## Overview
The Jarvis AI Project is a comprehensive framework for developing and experimenting with machine learning and deep learning models. It provides a structured approach to data processing, model training, and inference, making it easier for researchers and developers to build and evaluate AI systems.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project.
  - **models/**: Includes model definitions and architectures.
  - **data/**: Contains data processing and loading utilities.
  - **training/**: Manages training scripts and experiment tracking.
  - **inference/**: Handles model inference and predictions.

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model prototyping.

- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for all modules to ensure code quality and functionality.

- **config/**: Configuration files for model and training settings.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

- **setup.py**: Setup script for the project.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jarvis-ai-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- **Data Processing**: Use the functions in `src/data/preprocessing.py` for data normalization and augmentation.
- **Model Training**: Utilize the `Trainer` class in `src/training/trainer.py` to manage the training process.
- **Model Inference**: Use the `Predictor` class in `src/inference/predictor.py` for making predictions on new data.
