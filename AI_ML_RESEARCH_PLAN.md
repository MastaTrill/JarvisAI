# AI/ML Research & Prototyping Plan

## Focus Areas
1. **Explainable AI (XAI)**
   - Integrate libraries like SHAP or LIME for model interpretability.
   - Prototype feature importance and explanation dashboards.
2. **Multi-Modal Learning**
   - Research combining text, image, and tabular data in unified models.
   - Prototype a simple multi-modal pipeline using open datasets.
3. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
   - Explore RLlib or Stable Baselines for agent-based learning.
   - Prototype a basic RL environment and agent.

## Next Steps
- Select one area for immediate prototyping (recommend XAI for fastest impact).
- Set up a research notebook or script for experiments.
- Document findings and integration recommendations.
