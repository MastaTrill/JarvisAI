# Web Accessibility & Multi-language Support

## Accessibility Guidelines
- Ensure all UI elements are keyboard accessible
- Use ARIA labels for screen readers
- Provide high-contrast themes and scalable fonts

## Multi-language Support
- Use i18n libraries (e.g., i18next for React, vue-i18n for Vue)
- Store translation files in `web/locales/`
- Add a language switcher to the web UI

## Next Steps
- Audit the web interface for accessibility compliance
- Add at least one additional language as a demo
