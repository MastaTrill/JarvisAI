# Jarvis AI Project

## Overview
Jarvis AI is a comprehensive AI/ML project focused on developing machine learning and deep learning models. This project provides a structured approach to data processing, model training, and inference, utilizing popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **src/**: Contains the main source code for the project.
  - **models/**: Model definitions and architectures.
  - **data/**: Data processing and loading utilities.
  - **training/**: Training scripts and experiment management.
  - **inference/**: Model inference and prediction code.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions for configuration and logging.
  
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model prototyping.

- **tests/**: Unit tests for all modules to ensure code reliability.

- **config/**: Configuration files for model and training parameters.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd jarvis-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Loading**: Use the functions in `src/data/loaders.py` to load your datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess your data using functions from `src/data/preprocessors.py`.
3. **Model Training**: Train your models using the `Trainer` class in `src/training/trainer.py`.
4. **Model Inference**: Make predictions with your trained models using the `Predictor` class in `src/inference/predictor.py`.

## Data Preprocessing Pipeline

The `src/data/preprocessors.py` module provides a robust, production-ready preprocessing pipeline for your datasets. It includes:

- **Imputation**: Fill missing values with mean, median, or mode.
- **Outlier Removal**: Remove rows with outliers based on z-score.
- **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot encode categorical columns.
- **Normalization**: Standardize numeric columns to zero mean and unit variance.
- **Pipeline**: Chain all steps with `preprocess_pipeline`.

### Example Usage

```python
import pandas as pd
from src.data.preprocessors import preprocess_pipeline, split_data

# Load your data
# df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
processed_df = preprocess_pipeline(df, impute_strategy='mean', normalize=True, encode=True, outlier_removal=True)

# Split into train/validation sets
train_df, val_df = split_data(processed_df, train_size=0.8)
```

See the function docstrings in `src/data/preprocessors.py` for more details and customization options.

## Experiment Tracking
Track your experiments using MLflow or Weights & Biases as specified in the training scripts.
