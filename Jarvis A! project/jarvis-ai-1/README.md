# Jarvis AI Project

## Overview
Jarvis AI is a comprehensive AI/ML project focused on developing machine learning and deep learning models. This project provides a structured approach to data processing, model training, and inference, utilizing popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **src/**: Contains the main source code for the project.
  - **models/**: Model definitions and architectures.
  - **data/**: Data processing and loading utilities.
  - **training/**: Training scripts and experiment management.
  - **inference/**: Model inference and prediction code.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions for configuration and logging.
  
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model prototyping.

- **tests/**: Unit tests for all modules to ensure code reliability.

- **config/**: Configuration files for model and training parameters.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd jarvis-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Loading**: Use the functions in `src/data/loaders.py` to load your datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess your data using functions from `src/data/preprocessors.py`.
3. **Model Training**: Train your models using the `Trainer` class in `src/training/trainer.py`.
4. **Model Inference**: Make predictions with your trained models using the `Predictor` class in `src/inference/predictor.py`.

## Experiment Tracking
Track your experiments using MLflow or Weights & Biases as specified in the training scripts.
